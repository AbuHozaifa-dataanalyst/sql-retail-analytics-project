# 🛒 SQL Retail Analytics Project

## 📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **SQL skills for Retail Analytics** using a simulated multi-store retail dataset.
The goal is to analyze **sales performance, store performance, product trends, and customer behavior** using SQL queries commonly used by retail analysts.

The project mimics real-world analytics tasks performed in **supermarkets, fashion retail chains, and multi-store retail businesses**.

## 📊 Example Analysis

### Monthly Sales Trend

```sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT(Sale_Date,'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    SUM(Total_Amount) AS Monthly_Revenue
FROM Sales
GROUP BY FORMAT(Sale_Date,'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month;
```

---

### Top Performing Stores

```sql
SELECT 
    Store_ID,
    SUM(Total_Amount) AS Revenue
FROM Sales

---

### Store Ranking

```sql
SELECT 
    Store_ID,
    SUM(Total_Amount) AS Revenue,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY SUM(Total_Amount) DESC) AS Store_Rank
FROM Sales
GROUP BY Store_ID;
```
